# resilient-mlkit

The single measurement and gating tool for the Resilient avoided-loss model
portfolio. Built once; imported by all eight model repos; never reimplemented
per repo.

**Only mlkit emits numbers.** Any metric, loss, score, coverage figure or cost
that did not come out of a run of this CLI does not exist.

## Layout

- `src/resilient_mlkit/` — the package. 25 checks across 5 phases.
- `spine/` — the canonical docs and scaffolding synced into every model repo.
- `scripts/sync_spine.py` — propagates `spine/`. Canonical files are
  overwritten; seed files (escalations, blockers, allowlist, repo.toml) are
  written once and then owned by the repo.

## Statuses

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | Measured, and correct. Requires non-empty evidence. |
| `FAIL` | Measured, and wrong. |
| `NA` | Could not be measured here, with a reason. Never a pass. |
| `STALE` | Measured at a different git SHA than the one checked out. |
| `ESCALATED` | Reserved to the human signatory. |

`READY-TO-TRAIN` requires all 25 checks to pass. Six of them (S5, D1, D4, D5,
E4, E5) are human-only and always report `ESCALATED`, so **an agent cannot
drive a repo to READY-TO-TRAIN**. That is deliberate: those six are legal and
billing exposures, not code changes.

## Usage

    mlkit check --phase triage --repo blackout
    mlkit check --phase readiness
    mlkit check --portfolio
    mlkit notice --repo blackout
    mlkit allowlist verify

Exit codes: `0` all pass · `1` something failed (CI gates on this) · `3`
incomplete — unmeasured, stale or awaiting sign-off.
